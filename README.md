# Heavy file

This project is only for practicing and learning Rust language. Bad practices and inconsistencies may be present in project, the aim is to be able to detect them and fix it correctly.

**Note: Name will probably change.**

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are :

- [x] Listing files with their current weight
- [ ] Group recursively weight of files under a directory
- [ ] Add creation date, permission, ownership of each file
- [ ] Turn project into CLI
- [ ] List heaviest files in the whole filesystem

## Getting started

1. Build project `cargo build`
2. Execute binary `./target/debug/heavy_file`

Or 

1. Run main file `cargo run`

## Contributing
